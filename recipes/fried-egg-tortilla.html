        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon taco seasoning, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 (6 to 7-inch) flour tortilla</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat,
                    and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Carefully break egg into buttered skillet and cook until egg
                    white is opaque and egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>
                    Turn egg over, being careful not to break yolk;
                    sprinkle with taco seasoning and about half of cheese.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>
                    Gently place tortilla over egg and cheese,
                    and cook about 1 minute. Using a silicone egg turner,
                    flip the egg and tortilla, as one.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>
                    Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg,
                    and continue cooking until the egg is done to your liking
                    and the tortilla is warm and toasty, about 2 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>Slide tortilla and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.</p>
